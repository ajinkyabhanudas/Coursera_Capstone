    "As the most populated city in the United States, New York City is a great place to open a restaurant. According to the stats the cityâ€™s numbers have reached a record high bringing an increase of more than 5% in the last few years to about 8.6 million. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth in the population, the number of restaurants in NYC keeps growing as well. According to the National Restaurant Association, there were nearly 45,000 eating and drinking establishments, nearly 26,700 open restaurants in the city alone. Though the competition is high among New York City restaurants, there is great potential for success. These numbers also bring in challenges to the process of setting up a restaurant business. "
